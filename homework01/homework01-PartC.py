# NOTE: I couldn't figure out why my aspect ratio resizing was not working, even using external resources like
# the web and GPT tools. I also see that the composites are still imperfect due to the mis-matched aspect ratios.

# Lastly, I wasn't able to register the images. I couldn't figure out a way to use feature-matching advanced enough
# to perfectly align their features (ex: wheel to wheel, hood-to-hood, etc per image.)

# I generated three trials of differen car combinations. I realized that using an interactive selection tool was easier
# than trying to build polygons manually with coordinates.
